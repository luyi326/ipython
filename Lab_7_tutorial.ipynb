Brownian motions is typically modeled using a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk'>random walk</a>. In one-dimension, you can think of the particle starting at the origin of a number line and moving randomly to the left or the right. The distance the particle moves is drawn from some <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions'>distribution</a>, typically a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution'>gaussian distribution</a>. We then look at the particle's position as a function of time. The following code implements the simulation for 1000 steps."
